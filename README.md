## Overview
A company has reached out to us to find weather data from Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, the wants thhe temperature data for the months of June and December which will help them determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We will first connect to a sqlite database, which holds the weather data for Hawaii Oahu. Afterwards, we will run two queries getting data for both months. We will then put the data into dataframe, and get the statistical summary. We will then present and summarize our findings.


## Results

Here are the results from our query.

**First Point:** 
We can see that the average temperature for the month of June is `74°F`. Which translates to `23°C`. So, we can say that having an ice cream and surf shop is sustainable for the month of June.

**Second Point:** 
We can see that the average temperature for the month of June is `71°F`. Which translates to `21°C`. So, we can say that having an ice cream and surf shop is sustainable for the month of December.

**Third Point:** 
If we take into account just the minmum temps for th month of June and December, we can see that June has the lowest recorded temperature of 17°C and December is 13°C. So maybe having an ice cream and surf shop may not be busy or proiftable on these lower temperature days as people are less likely to have ice cream or go in the water for surfing. 


## Summary
Our recomendations to the owner of the ice cream and surf shop would be to have less inventory for days they suspect to have colder temperatures.
